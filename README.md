# 🚢 Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📝 Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the famous **Titanic dataset**.  
The main goal is to analyze passenger data, identify survival patterns, and understand which factors influenced survival rates during the disaster.

---

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset contains details of Titanic passengers, including:
- **Age**
- **Gender**
- **Passenger Class (Pclass)**
- **Fare**
- **Embarkation Port (Embarked)**
- **Survival Status (0 = Did not survive, 1 = Survived)**

---

## 🔎 Key Steps in EDA
- 📂 **Data Importing** – Loaded dataset in Python (pandas)  
- 🧹 **Data Cleaning** – Handled missing values in Age (median), Embarked (mode), and Fare  
- 📈 **Feature Exploration** – Analyzed survival by:
  - Gender
  - Passenger Class
  - Age Groups
  - Embarkation Port  
- 📊 **Data Visualization** – Used bar charts, histograms, and heatmaps to reveal survival trends
----

## 📉 Insights & Findings
- **Gender**: Females had a significantly higher survival rate compared to males.  
- **Passenger Class**: First-class passengers had a better chance of survival than lower classes.  
- **Age**: Children had a higher survival probability than adults.  
- **Embarkation Port**: Passengers who embarked from certain ports showed different survival patterns.  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy)  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for visualization)  
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab**
